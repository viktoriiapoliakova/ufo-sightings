Welcome to my project exploring UFO sightings in the USA using R & Shiny.

The dataset I chose comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings. It contains data of over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings over the last century, collected by the National UFO Reporting Center (a US-based organization that investigates UFO sightings and reports of contact with UFO).

There are two versions of this dataset published on Kaggle: scrubbed and complete. According to the owner of the dataset (National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)), “the complete data includes entries where the location of the sighting was not found or blank (0.8146%) or have an erroneous or blank time (8.0237%)”. I chose to work with the scrubbed dataset for more accurate results.

The original dataset contains 80332 observations and 12 variables. The tidy version of the dataset contains 66516 observations and 10 variables.

While I’m not sure whether I find Unidentified Flying Objects & paranormal activity believable, I certainly find people’s deep interest about them very fascinating. I thought that analyzing this kind of data would be fun and could lead to a lot of interesting insights about people’s experiences and thoughts about UFOs and aliens. Most importantly: for me, data analysis is a lot about storytelling, and after the initial glimpse into the dataset, I saw an interesting narrative.

My main objective for this project was: with my Shiny App, I wanted to take the user on a journey to find out about UFO activity & people’s experiences with them across the world.
